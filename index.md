  Hi! I am a MSc Artificial Intelligence student at the University of Amsterdam. As an ELLIS Honours Student, I am currently writing my master thesis under the joint supervision of <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/h.c.vanhoof/homepage/">Herke van Hoof</a> from UvA and <a href="https://ori.ox.ac.uk/people/ingmar-posner/">Ingmar Posner</a> from the University of Oxford.

  My main interest lies in learning and using object-centric representations in reinforcement learning to make learning from scratch as well as adapting to novel scenarios more efficient. <br> Take the following example: If you want to climb a tree for the first time, you make use of already knowing what a tree is. Consequently, when you encounter the tree you want to climb, you perceive it as an entity instead of a collection of low-level sensory input (such as a collection of colors in your vision). This enables you to learn much faster how to climb the tree.

  Last summer, I did an internship in the Autonomous Learning Group of <a href="https://is.mpg.de/person/gmartius">Georg Martius</a> at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in TÃ¼bingen where I worked on neuro-algorithmic policies.
